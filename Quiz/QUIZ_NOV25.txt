INPUT:
EX1: INTEGER
EX2: INTEGER
ASSIGN1: INTEGER
ASSIGN2: INTEGER
NUM_STUDENTS: INTEGER

OUTPUT:
AVERAGE_STUDENT: FLOAT
AVERAGE: FLOAT

INTERNAL DATA:
WEIGHT_EX2 = 100- WEIGHT_EX1 : INTEGER
WEIGHT_ASSIGN2 = 100- WEIGHT_ASSIGN1 : INTEGER
ARRAY_GRADE[NUM_STUDENTS] : ARRAY OF INTEGER WITH LENGHT OF NUMBER OS STUDENTS


PROCEDURE:

- READ THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THIS CLASS
- READ THE WEIGHT OF EACH GRADE (EXAMS AND ASSINGS)
- TEST IF EACH GRADE IS BETWEEN 0 AND 100
	IF EACH GRADE EX1 , EX2, ASSIGN1, ASSIGN2  >=0 AND <=100 THEN
 		CALCULATE THE PERCENT OF EACH GRADE REPRESENT
		TEST IF SUM OF EX1 AND EX2 IS EQUAL 100
 		TEST IF SUM OF ASSIGN1 AND ASSIGN2 IS EQUAL 100
- READ THE 4 GRADES FOR EACH STUDENT
		CALCULATE THE FINAL STUDENT GRADE
		TEST IF FINAL STUDENT GRADE IS >= 60 THEN
			DISPLAY THE RESULT 
				( GRADE >= 60) : APPROVED
				( GRADE < 60)  : REPROVED
		
	ELSE
		DISPLAY THE ERROR OF THE GRADE VALUE	

- CALCULATE THE AVERAGE OF CLASS
	AVERAGE = SUM OF ALL GRADE STUDENT / NUM_STUDENTS
- DISPLAY THIS AVERAGE;
